# Tesseract API
### Laravel 12 Stateless API Project

This project was created for demo purposes and to learn by implementing Laravel's best practices.

In this project, users have albums that can be set to **public**, **private**, **shared via email**, or **shared with a group of users**. Each item within an album can also be shared using the same permission settings.

**Database seeding** creates two users, **Maliketh** and **Malenia**, with default passwords set to `password`. Maliketh has four albums:

-   1 public album
-   1 private album
-   1 album shared via email (using Maleniaâ€™s email address)
-   1 album shared with a group `Friends` (which includes Malenia)

This setup allows Malenia to view 3 out of 4 albums through different sharing methods. Each album also contains items with varying sharing permissions. For more details, refer to the seeding logic in `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php`.

Additionally, an album can include a `direct_access_slug` for direct access, even if the album is marked as private.
